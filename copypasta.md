Do you hate profanity? Are you a church person? “Yes” to both? That’s okay, then. My pastor swears loud as shit though when he’s not at service. I recall one time that he screamed loud as fuck when he discovered that a member of the local choir ran away with the tithes, especially because saint-head was planning to buy a brand-new limousine with his precious Jesus stripper money, no tax. Pope Walmart DCLXVI was furious when he knew that the money was donated to help tsunami victims. It’s a shame that even though that he has all the Roman numerals appended to his name, he lacks the M, which stands for “motherfucker”. He personally hides a .9 behind the parish cross, and he’s ready to pontificate the asshole who ran away with his lunch money.  

ChatGPT? What the fuck is that?

Merzbow is one of the greatest musicians of all time. His approach to lyrics is always so thought-provoking, and his choice of sound is a beautiful symphony of melodic, genuine cadence that is relaxing to everyone’s ears. I have never encountered a musician as creative and awe-inspiring as him. His dulcet tones cater to all listener’s ears, shit, even Justin Bieber can’t reach the levels of maestro this crestfallen composer has. Truly a pioneer of his own genre, a master of his own craft. The musicians that spawned from the inspirations he innately spreads with much thoughtless effort, left a visible dent in the mainstream music industry so hard, that it has surpassed and toppled over many modern contemporary pop artists, and it just happened so unexpectedly.  

Remember bud, it doesn’t have to make sense, nor follow a specific kind of pattern. Just go with the flow and let it all out. It doesn’t matter how bad your output will be, no one’s going to check and compare this garbage and conclude that this low-tier crappy writing isn’t as remarkable as, for example, George Orwell and the ilk. See that? Your incorrect usage of particular words doesn’t affect your throughput, doesn’t it? Nobody gives a damn on what fucking standard you should be using, because that’s the god-damn point, write whatever comes into your head and spew out all the words on this paper. Crap, if somebody gives you shit for supposedly low quality, feeble, amateur-ass writing, ignore them. You’ll see that they hate you because they can’t do the things you can do.  

We strongly encourage the Japanese Government to retaliate fury on the United States with two nuclear bombs. We also recommend firebombing at least one major city, to compensate with the Bombing of Tokyo, which is also a World War II-related tragedy. Do this, in exchange of revising all their textbooks and scholarly articles to show the correct number of atrocities that the Imperial Japanese Army has committed on their colonies, instead of downplaying them for saving face and historical revisionism. We suggest to firebomb Alabama, due to the high numbers of incestuous relationships on between almost everyone there, God help us.  

Eyes. They provide sight, make us see the world around us. Losing sight is one of the worst things can ever happen to man. Getting deaf, probably, is just as bad as going blind, but for most of us, it’s losing the sense of vision that’s horrifying. Imagine becoming incapable of seeing things. What used to be there is now pitch black. If you’re born blind, then you don’t even know what black looks like, because you never had sight in the first place, therefore, no visual memories left implanted in your brain to visualize as a last resort, if there was even a choice like that.  

I am yet to be caught using Discord light mode. I don’t think I deserve the one-sided condemnations, as it is only a matter of preference on what theme I want to use. Seriously though, I think it looks really neat on Discord, you’re just to seeing it in this dull, cadet blue gray color all the time. Trust me, the moment you make the switch, the annexation and the hilarity it will eventually ensue, the more you will stick to it in the near future. All these people think I’m being asinine for doing something I like, I mean, come on, I’m not harming anybody. Aside from my retinas, but who the hell cares, and why should you even care about me using light theme in the first place? Is it jarring for you to see bright lights on a screen? The world’s been like that for more than a decade, you know, and I think the aesthetic beauty it provides my eyes further emphasizes my need to switch to light mode for all eternity. It would probably suck for you, but not so much for me. I seriously can’t stand seeing white text on a dark screen. For some unknown reason, every time I look at white text on a black screen, all of a sudden, I somewhat get a little bit dizzy and nauseous just by looking at it. I know that it doesn’t seem believable, but trust me, I’m only doing this for the sake of my own health, and as I mentioned earlier, the white backdrop is aesthetically pleasing to my eyeballs. Discord is not the only application that I use light mode for. Whenever I write some code, I always have it set to a very bright, luminescent, blinding white. If some other programmer sees me doing these forbidden practices, they would probably banish me from their realm, sharing the news to other developers about the man who makes use of ridiculously bright screens as a means of writing their code. It’s not like they see what kind of code I’m writing anyway, I mean, I am painfully aware that the code I write is awfully shit, bad formatting, outdated practices, inconsistent variable names, tons of commented-out code that I think “will be used later”, you name it. Still, light mode is life, and dark mode should crawl back from the abyssal depths from whence it came. Experience comes in the cost of my eyeballs, and I’m willing to trade knowledge for it.  

You are Hitler, thinking of what spark of inspiration to start painting your next masterpiece. You suddenly remember that you have the absolute power and insanity needed to generate a piece of work no one has ever conceived before. It will cost you human lives, though, and on a very specific race that you have unfounded hate on. A pistol is cocked and loaded tucked in your right leather pocket, ready to make an unfortunate soul taste hot lead if the moment comes close.  

As the cuckoo clocks of hell strike twelve, the mangled throes of the contorted finches echo and reverberate throughout the soul-dead cellar. Behind the draperies lie an untouched box, taped shut. I cut it open with a bottle shard I found scattered near from where I woke up bloodied. Inside was a bunch of unusual-looking ornaments and knick-knacks, some etched with inscriptions of unknown origin. On the corner of my eye, a blood-red face with holes for eye sockets can be somewhat seen. It doesn’t seem to go out of my sight, like it follows me wherever I look, as if it is permanently etched into my eyeballs, only that I can see it. It is a little blurry though, as it was positioned in a way that it is always there, by peripheral vision. I can’t look at it directly, as it is always on the side of my eye. Closing both of my eyes see black, save for the red visage. For this time though, I can see that it has its mouth wide open, pure black nothingness, slightly moving, like it was regurgitating something but nothing comes out.  

Check out my piss-poor time management skills! You won’t believe what happens next! I scheduled a meeting by 9:00, I fucking went there at like, 12:00! God fucking damn, no wonder my lackeys look very angry the moment I stepped inside that cluster fuck of a meeting. Didn’t even talk shit, just went with the usual business bull crap that everyone gets sick of hearing on every fucking meeting, ever. Would you think outside of that stupid fucking box? Reinvent the wheel? Synchronize? God, those greedy cunts thinking they’re contributing ass loads worth of human history every fucking time those buzzwords spew out from their disgruntled faces. Fucking figureheads, dickheads ought to be smashed repeatedly on the face with rusty mining equipment just so they can get a sense of reality on how badly they are fucked by the upper echelon cocksuckers who don’t have a single ounce of care about them, at all.  

Autonomous sensory meridian response is a compulsory tactic used by virgin shut-ins who have nothing else better to do with their lives. It has been observed that these species of subhuman employ such tactics in order to cope themselves regarding the hardships that the real world provides. These virgin losers are also observed to be living under their parents’ basement, where they are also seen cohabitating with their pillows that allow such cogent and bizarre interactions between these lumps of blubber fat. The species are also confirmed that they rarely go near the stairs of their basement, much less the hatch used to enable safe passage to the overworld, and it is scientifically concluded that these kinds of lowlifes do not engage in any kind of body cleaning. They are extremely resistant to commercial deodorant, as even wiping it under their sweaty and smelly armpits do not seem such to have a noticeable effect on them, other than making them seem more annoyed, mad, and making them more attracted to the spoiling slice of pizza lying on the basement carpet sprinkled with mildew mold with a tinge of dead ants. Since they rarely go upstairs, they are also rarely seen getting themselves in contact with even the tiniest amount of hydrogen oxide, a good example of correlation does imply causation, at least on the case of smelly, basement-dwelling motherfuckers.  

Did it hit you yet? Did my words hit you yet? Does it matter if you let it all go, only for it quickly wither away? Your screams for help disappeared as quickly as it got out, it’s inevitable. Wonder why you’re being ignored after all this time? You know damn well that your desperate cries for help won’t get noticed if you don’t show it, yet here we are. The more you ask for it, the more you look annoying to some, and that’s a downward spiral you’ve no chance getting out of. You try to make connections with people you meet, yet you fail to seal the knot. You know too fucking well that you’re the problem, not them. You can only mitigate being like this though, which is way better in my opinion, than say, actively pursuing on making new foundations, because that will only make it worse, you damn recluse. That’s what you get for sugarcoating everything, you paint yourself a world full of colors, where all black death is now covered with vibrant patches of bright rose. Those green eyes of yours, they leer with a hint of envy, because you know that your life sucks so bad, that you start comparing your situations to theirs. You start to think on how can you live like them, and then you realize that they deal with the same amount of shit as you, only that they handle their problems way better than you. You can write all you want and if that’s the only thing you can do, I say you’re screwed because your writing sucks (all of this).  

Discord’s your only safe haven, any other platform is a no-go. You’re always on there, to show that you’re not dead yet. Oftentimes, you launch Discord and leave it like that for hours, without actually doing anything on the app, while you do something else different in the background. Yes, that sounds stupid. It seems like you’re waiting for someone to shoot the shit with, which doesn’t happen very often. If it does, you go all elated and shit, giggle like an idiot because you’re talking to a real human being, not the bot you created some months ago. You usually don’t start conversations because you know well enough how often you get left on read, or none at all, so it’s something you don’t find yourself investing in. Sometimes they do respond, and that’s a good thing. It’s not just on Discord where this happens, though, but it’s still a very risky gambit to take.  

Will you stop complaining if someone finally takes you seriously? Not really sure about that, but to save face, you always laugh to conceal it all. Right now, you have a well-defined backup plan that you can set off at any time if something goes awry. It’s classified as of now, and you’re not going to be the one telling your peers if the plan went well.  

Come on, man, it’s only this time that you’re opening up on what’s going on with you, yet you still get shit? Remember this, whenever you launch Discord, and see that red circle on the bottom right corner of a server icon, you think that someone wants to talk with you, only for you to find out that it’s a motherfucking @everyone mention wake-up call. That’s the most annoying shit ever. Don’t you wish that was supposed to be your name? And now you’re posting stupid manifesto shit on GitHub.  

As it swelled between the burgeoning depths of the abyss, the wailing throes bounded throughout the damascene walls, echoing back screams of manifested agony, reverberating on all corners of the sullen room. Managing to avoid Scylla and, hopefully Charybdis too, they managed to see a measly chink in the armor and slink through unscathed, without scars nor serious wounds. Unfortunately for them, on the blink of their prescient eyes, on the very last second, while absconding, they managed to jump out of the frying pan, only to find themselves set afoot on an even dire situation, onto the seething flames of wrath, ready to engulf and reduce them to cinders within mere seconds. They watched as their pale flesh burned with passion and crackled with the sound of raging inferno, becoming redder the longer they gaze at their burnt skin. Eventually, what was once thought of to be humanoid figures dancing on the scorching flames, are now turned into a lifeless, burnt pile of charred bones, with the lingering smell of burnt carbon mixed into the smoky air. Their fate was destined to be like this, as they have not thought of it even once from whence, they ran towards into. How unfortunate it is for the welkin-men regarding their unsound fate. If it were not for the droll rivers, they would’ve survived.  

I want to see a universe where Paramore became a math rock band. Imagine Hayley singing about some weird teenager stuff in odd time signatures, I think that would be cool. I’m cool with their current style now, but I wish that they had more songs that included screaming in it, like that song from their debut album. Anxiety is cheap, as they say.  

Snorting angel dust relieves me the most when I’m at my lowest points. I also drink a pint of weed juice, made from powdered blunt, mixed with a bit of sugar, and a liter of tap water. I have no idea if weed is edible, nor it should be taken orally, but I haven’t experienced any kind of serious side effects when performing this macabre maneuver. It’s funny to me that my peeps around me advise against doing it. But here I am, alive and still kicking, enjoying life with my personal weed jar collection. I might have to buy a new swath of coke bricks, though, and a new bong pipe, too. Shit’s too cloudy for me to blow voodoo incantations in.  

I watch the bitter tears slalom down grief-stricken faces, for a moment’s time, I feel I am the god of which they speak. Under the guise of anonymity, I masquerade in thrilling mockery, an erection juts begrudgingly from twixt my silken Sunday pleats.  

Do I want to know? You caught us, we’re still working on getting lyrics for this one.  

Sowing the seeds of shit, fucking everything putting their hands against me, masturbating themselves to eventual self-satisfaction, twats seeking temporary adrenaline rushes for ephemeral moments of elation, you all damn suck, people taking advantage of other people is not a good pedestal to support yourself on, your heartstrings got you by the neck, put yourself out of your fucking misery, not supporting dick heads whose main motive is to deceive and manipulate their kin. Let all that fucking shit out, let it out, nothing’s stopping you, fuck the barricades preventing you to speak up, wake the fuck up from your dreamless slumber, be cognizant of all the treacherous bullshit that has been thrown at you, scream it all out to hell and fucking back, not a single care in the world, bullets speeding through the air hoping to see stars with your head, no, it don’t care no target to hit, fuck that, just let the fucking monster in your head out, unleash hell, don’t be afraid to spit scorching hellfire against the earth that has treated you like shit after all these years, be mad at the fucking world because you’re obliged to, don’t hide your anger behind that thin veil of yours, wake the fuck up and have those motherfuckers get the taste of their own medicine, I don’t care if it involves guns, killing and shit, you all bitches have scarred and done enough irreversible psychological fucking damage that I’ve become too mentally unstable to recover, so shut the fuck up and have this barrel stuck up, point-blank at the roof of your fucking mouth, no one cares if your brain matter splatters against the wall of shame you’ve built, your hypocrisy and insensitivity regarding our situation is a complete disgrace, I’m more happy that you’re fucking dead and rotting than living to breathe another life, ready to fuck with another innocent dude’s life. You built a podium founded on your own sins and lies, polished by honeyed words, meant to deceive innocent people from your lip services. I relate more to the rotting walls of my cell, confined to do time until I die, my sentence will outlive my life, my hair will become white first than my prison bars rust red, I’m destined to expire here alone. I etch the walls of my cell with a dull, pointed rock, where I count all the days of my duty by five, and I think, currently I have a couple thousand of tallies I can visibly see. Saliva comes out dry from my mouth, and blood is indeed thicker than water. All the people I see around me don bats and arms, where even a person wearing civilian garments are not a usual sight. I can’t see to find meanings between my tally marks, only dying white paint. The flakes seem to pile up on the floor, and are carried by the occasional wind, coming from the top of my cell. That tiny window up there is my only source of light; it’s pitch-black fucking dark when nighttime falls. I’m the jester in front of my audience, and I’m my own audience, and I laugh from my own jokes, where I occasionally choke and gag from inhaling shit dust floating in the air. Deranged and unhinged as I am, nothing stops me on trying to find my next bus stop to my next dominion, because it is in hell where she waits for me.
