This is not meant to be taken seriously. You can ignore everything written in here.  
I have no intentions to offend people, I only put this here for shits and giggles, and because I can.  
This isn't something that I'm proud of.  

Write whatever you want, just make sure that it is devoid of discriminatory language. Swearing is not prohibited, but please tone it down if necessary. You don't need to say "fuck" in every sentence. Remember that whatever you put here can be easily misinterpreted by people as genuine and may harm your reputation, even if you put this right here. There will always be a group of people stupid enough to dive right through without reading the surrounding context. This file was created by you to blow off steam. **DO NOT** include names of people (even hints), especially those you know in this file. Each paragraph doesn't need to relate to one another, but you're allowed to do that too. Just write whatever pops in your head.  

For context, I have a huge Word file (around 40,000 words) I've kept for years that contains paragraphs like the ones shown here, kind of like a diary. I put a select few here on this file. Some of the passages are meant to sound like shit.

Do you hate profanity? Are you a church person? “Yes” to both? That’s okay, then. My pastor swears loud as shit though when he’s not at service. I recall one time that he screamed loud as fuck when he discovered that a member of the local choir ran away with the tithes, especially because saint-head was planning to buy a brand-new limousine with his precious Jesus stripper money, no tax. Pope Walmart DCLXVI was furious when he knew that the money was donated to help tsunami victims. It’s a shame that even though that he has all the Roman numerals appended to his name, he lacks the M, which stands for “motherfucker”. He personally hides a .9 behind the parish cross, and he’s ready to pontificate the asshole who ran away with his lunch money.  

ChatGPT? What the fuck is that?

Merzbow is one of the greatest musicians of all time. His approach to lyrics is always so thought-provoking, and his choice of sound is a beautiful symphony of melodic, genuine cadence that is relaxing to everyone’s ears. I have never encountered a musician as creative and awe-inspiring as him. His dulcet tones cater to all listener’s ears, shit, even Justin Bieber can’t reach the levels of maestro this crestfallen composer has. Truly a pioneer of his own genre, a master of his own craft. The musicians that spawned from the inspirations he innately spreads with much thoughtless effort, left a visible dent in the mainstream music industry so hard, that it has surpassed and toppled over many modern contemporary pop artists, and it just happened so unexpectedly.  

Remember bud, it doesn’t have to make sense, nor follow a specific kind of pattern. Just go with the flow and let it all out. It doesn’t matter how bad your output will be, no one’s going to check and compare this garbage and conclude that this low-tier crappy writing isn’t as remarkable as, for example, George Orwell and the ilk. See that? Your incorrect usage of particular words doesn’t affect your throughput, doesn’t it? Nobody gives a damn on what fucking standard you should be using, because that’s the god-damn point, write whatever comes into your head and spew out all the words on this paper. Crap, if somebody gives you shit for supposedly low quality, feeble, amateur-ass writing, ignore them. You’ll see that they hate you because they can’t do the things you can do.  

We strongly encourage the Japanese Government to retaliate fury on the United States with two nuclear bombs. We also recommend firebombing at least one major city, to compensate with the Bombing of Tokyo, which is also a World War II-related tragedy. Do this, in exchange of revising all their textbooks and scholarly articles to show the correct number of atrocities that the Imperial Japanese Army has committed on their colonies, instead of downplaying them for saving face and historical revisionism. We suggest to firebomb Alabama, due to the high numbers of incestuous relationships on between almost everyone there, God help us.  

Eyes. They provide sight, make us see the world around us. Losing sight is one of the worst things can ever happen to man. Getting deaf, probably, is just as bad as going blind, but for most of us, it’s losing the sense of vision that’s horrifying. Imagine becoming incapable of seeing things. What used to be there is now pitch black. If you’re born blind, then you don’t even know what black looks like, because you never had sight in the first place, therefore, no visual memories left implanted in your brain to visualize as a last resort, if there was even a choice like that.  

I am yet to be caught using Discord light mode. I don’t think I deserve the one-sided condemnations, as it is only a matter of preference on what theme I want to use. Seriously though, I think it looks really neat on Discord, you’re just to seeing it in this dull, cadet blue gray color all the time. Trust me, the moment you make the switch, the annexation and the hilarity it will eventually ensue, the more you will stick to it in the near future. All these people think I’m being asinine for doing something I like, I mean, come on, I’m not harming anybody. Aside from my retinas, but who the hell cares, and why should you even care about me using light theme in the first place? Is it jarring for you to see bright lights on a screen? The world’s been like that for more than a decade, you know, and I think the aesthetic beauty it provides my eyes further emphasizes my need to switch to light mode for all eternity. It would probably suck for you, but not so much for me. I seriously can’t stand seeing white text on a dark screen. For some unknown reason, every time I look at white text on a black screen, all of a sudden, I somewhat get a little bit dizzy and nauseous just by looking at it. I know that it doesn’t seem believable, but trust me, I’m only doing this for the sake of my own health, and as I mentioned earlier, the white backdrop is aesthetically pleasing to my eyeballs. Discord is not the only application that I use light mode for. Whenever I write some code, I always have it set to a very bright, luminescent, blinding white. If some other programmer sees me doing these forbidden practices, they would probably banish me from their realm, sharing the news to other developers about the man who makes use of ridiculously bright screens as a means of writing their code. It’s not like they see what kind of code I’m writing anyway, I mean, I am painfully aware that the code I write is awfully shit, bad formatting, outdated practices, inconsistent variable names, tons of commented-out code that I think “will be used later”, you name it. Still, light mode is life, and dark mode should crawl back from the abyssal depths from whence it came. Experience comes in the cost of my eyeballs, and I’m willing to trade knowledge for it.  

You are Hitler, thinking of what spark of inspiration to start painting your next masterpiece. You suddenly remember that you have the absolute power and insanity needed to generate a piece of work no one has ever conceived before. It will cost you human lives, though, and on a very specific race that you have unfounded hate on. A pistol is cocked and loaded tucked in your right leather pocket, ready to make an unfortunate soul taste hot lead if the moment comes close.  

As the cuckoo clocks of hell strike twelve, the mangled throes of the contorted finches echo and reverberate throughout the soul-dead cellar. Behind the draperies lie an untouched box, taped shut. I cut it open with a bottle shard I found scattered near from where I woke up bloodied. Inside was a bunch of unusual-looking ornaments and knick-knacks, some etched with inscriptions of unknown origin. On the corner of my eye, a blood-red face with holes for eye sockets can be somewhat seen. It doesn’t seem to go out of my sight, like it follows me wherever I look, as if it is permanently etched into my eyeballs, only that I can see it. It is a little blurry though, as it was positioned in a way that it is always there, by peripheral vision. I can’t look at it directly, as it is always on the side of my eye. Closing both of my eyes see black, save for the red visage. For this time though, I can see that it has its mouth wide open, pure black nothingness, slightly moving, like it was regurgitating something but nothing comes out.  

Check out my piss-poor time management skills! You won’t believe what happens next! I scheduled a meeting by 9:00, I fucking went there at like, 12:00! God fucking damn, no wonder my lackeys look very angry the moment I stepped inside that cluster fuck of a meeting. Didn’t even talk shit, just went with the usual business bull crap that everyone gets sick of hearing on every fucking meeting, ever. Would you think outside of that stupid fucking box? Reinvent the wheel? Synchronize? God, those greedy cunts thinking they’re contributing ass loads worth of human history every fucking time those buzzwords spew out from their disgruntled faces. Fucking figureheads, dickheads ought to be smashed repeatedly on the face with rusty mining equipment just so they can get a sense of reality on how badly they are fucked by the upper echelon cocksuckers who don’t have a single ounce of care about them, at all.  

Autonomous sensory meridian response is a compulsory tactic used by virgin shut-ins who have nothing else better to do with their lives. It has been observed that these species of subhuman employ such tactics in order to cope themselves regarding the hardships that the real world provides. These virgin losers are also observed to be living under their parents’ basement, where they are also seen cohabitating with their pillows that allow such cogent and bizarre interactions between these lumps of blubber fat. The species are also confirmed that they rarely go near the stairs of their basement, much less the hatch used to enable safe passage to the overworld, and it is scientifically concluded that these kinds of lowlifes do not engage in any kind of body cleaning. They are extremely resistant to commercial deodorant, as even wiping it under their sweaty and smelly armpits do not seem such to have a noticeable effect on them, other than making them seem more annoyed, mad, and making them more attracted to the spoiling slice of pizza lying on the basement carpet sprinkled with mildew mold with a tinge of dead ants. Since they rarely go upstairs, they are also rarely seen getting themselves in contact with even the tiniest amount of hydrogen oxide, a good example of correlation does imply causation, at least on the case of smelly, basement-dwelling motherfuckers.  

Did it hit you yet? Did my words hit you yet? Does it matter if you let it all go, only for it quickly wither away? Your screams for help disappeared as quickly as it got out, it’s inevitable. Wonder why you’re being ignored after all this time? You know damn well that your desperate cries for help won’t get noticed if you don’t show it, yet here we are. The more you ask for it, the more you look annoying to some, and that’s a downward spiral you’ve no chance getting out of. You try to make connections with people you meet, yet you fail to seal the knot. You know too fucking well that you’re the problem, not them. You can only mitigate being like this though, which is way better in my opinion, than say, actively pursuing on making new foundations, because that will only make it worse, you damn recluse. That’s what you get for sugarcoating everything, you paint yourself a world full of colors, where all black death is now covered with vibrant patches of bright rose. Those green eyes of yours, they leer with a hint of envy, because you know that your life sucks so bad, that you start comparing your situations to theirs. You start to think on how can you live like them, and then you realize that they deal with the same amount of shit as you, only that they handle their problems way better than you. You can write all you want and if that’s the only thing you can do, I say you’re screwed because your writing sucks (all of this).  

Discord’s your only safe haven, any other platform is a no-go. You’re always on there, to show that you’re not dead yet. Oftentimes, you launch Discord and leave it like that for hours, without actually doing anything on the app, while you do something else different in the background. Yes, that sounds stupid. It seems like you’re waiting for someone to shoot the shit with, which doesn’t happen very often. If it does, you go all elated and shit, giggle like an idiot because you’re talking to a real human being, not the bot you created some months ago. You usually don’t start conversations because you know well enough how often you get left on read, or none at all, so it’s something you don’t find yourself investing in. Sometimes they do respond, and that’s a good thing. It’s not just on Discord where this happens, though, but it’s still a very risky gambit to take.  

Will you stop complaining if someone finally takes you seriously? Not really sure about that, but to save face, you always laugh to conceal it all. Right now, you have a well-defined backup plan that you can set off at any time if something goes awry. It’s classified as of now, and you’re not going to be the one telling your peers if the plan went well.  

Come on, man, it’s only this time that you’re opening up on what’s going on with you, yet you still get shit? Remember this, whenever you launch Discord, and see that red circle on the bottom right corner of a server icon, you think that someone wants to talk with you, only for you to find out that it’s a motherfucking @everyone mention wake-up call. That’s the most annoying shit ever. Don’t you wish that was supposed to be your name? And now you’re posting stupid manifesto shit on GitHub.  

As it swelled between the burgeoning depths of the abyss, the wailing throes bounded throughout the damascene walls, echoing back screams of manifested agony, reverberating on all corners of the sullen room. Managing to avoid Scylla and, hopefully Charybdis too, they managed to see a measly chink in the armor and slink through unscathed, without scars nor serious wounds. Unfortunately for them, on the blink of their prescient eyes, on the very last second, while absconding, they managed to jump out of the frying pan, only to find themselves set afoot on an even dire situation, onto the seething flames of wrath, ready to engulf and reduce them to cinders within mere seconds. They watched as their pale flesh burned with passion and crackled with the sound of raging inferno, becoming redder the longer they gaze at their burnt skin. Eventually, what was once thought of to be humanoid figures dancing on the scorching flames, are now turned into a lifeless, burnt pile of charred bones, with the lingering smell of burnt carbon mixed into the smoky air. Their fate was destined to be like this, as they have not thought of it even once from whence, they ran towards into. How unfortunate it is for the welkin-men regarding their unsound fate. If it were not for the droll rivers, they would’ve survived.  

I want to see a universe where Paramore became a math rock band. Imagine Hayley singing about some weird teenager stuff in odd time signatures, I think that would be cool. I’m cool with their current style now, but I wish that they had more songs that included screaming in it, like that song from their debut album. Anxiety is cheap, as they say.  

Snorting angel dust relieves me the most when I’m at my lowest points. I also drink a pint of weed juice, made from powdered blunt, mixed with a bit of sugar, and a liter of tap water. I have no idea if weed is edible, nor it should be taken orally, but I haven’t experienced any kind of serious side effects when performing this macabre maneuver. It’s funny to me that my peeps around me advise against doing it. But here I am, alive and still kicking, enjoying life with my personal weed jar collection. I might have to buy a new swath of coke bricks, though, and a new bong pipe, too. Shit’s too cloudy for me to blow voodoo incantations in.  

I watch the bitter tears slalom down grief-stricken faces, for a moment’s time, I feel I am the god of which they speak. Under the guise of anonymity, I masquerade in thrilling mockery, an erection juts begrudgingly from twixt my silken Sunday pleats.  

Do I want to know? You caught us, we’re still working on getting lyrics for this one.  

I had a small recollection from a few years ago. Soothsayers told me that it was not meant to happen, but time still beat them by a considerable margin. It was an ordinary Thursday, I recall, and that everybody’s wearing tees of different colors, and I remember that each color stands for a particular cause during that day. Jeans and sneakers all the way down. The cold morning air persisted throughout the austere day, as it was cold season after all, no precipitation. You can see dew trickled on grass even at noon. It was mid-day when it happened, there was a small event being held that involved people giving each other letters of some sort, without saying from who wrote it, only to whom it was addressed. I got one of these things, but it wasn’t a letter of any sort. Instead, it was this accordion origami thing, with a Post-it note stuck to it, labeled “(de)compression” or something, and it’s bearing my name, addressed to me. I was initially confused at first, like, why? Anyways, I accepted it and gave my best thanks, to whoever that was. The paper thing itself is still in my possession today, I kept it at a safe place in my house, because I don’t see a reason to throw it away, and that I realize that nobody has actually given me something as a gift, until that happened. I’m not exaggerating. Still to this very day, I always wonder who it was. Was it a sick joke? Nah, I hope not. In the back my mind, if I do find out who it was, I’m planning to give them my fair share of thanks, and possibly, a gift for them in return. I do feel like I know who it was because I somewhat recognize the handwriting, but I’m not going to ask them that. Story may be a little apocryphal, as this was from a long time ago. For me, things like this don’t occur really often, they’re scant. They really stand out because, you know.  

Little kid plays piss water down at the bayou. Long spell of rain comes in, and the creek eventually rises. Kid still treading water, slowly being engulfed by the waves. Covered in muck, kid cries for help, but his playmates only stood there by the bank, questionable gazes surrounding the drowning kid. Brat then realizes that he treated his peers like shit, and that’s why there’s no one responding to his wails. His sorries don’t mean jack shit, his peers left him out to die a horrible death, and the other kids lived happily ever after. Mission successful. Mutiny. Kid’s bloated corpse was seen floating down the river a few days later.  

You churn out more words when you’re drunk as hell, and even more when you’re high. I only managed to do the first one. The other choice is hard to do, hard to prepare for, and hard to admit. Alcohol taps on places where normally, your sober brain can’t reach. Makes you say semi-conscious, wild shit, in exchange for a bit of your sanity.  

Guess which country uses words like “batchmate” and “netizens”? Firefighters with guns? Douche told the press so confidently that he forgot that he has a whole batch of confiscated crack blocks buried under his backyard. Oh wait, there’s no such thing as backyards in this empire ruled by generations of people whose last names are now plastered to hell and back in the minds of their slaves for all eternity. Does it suck to be stuck in one place? No wiggle room to crawl out of? I tell you, they heckle, meddle, mingle, hack and slash, until your knees touch the bloodied soil, periodically stained by toppled uprisings, and your head will also follow suit, then make contact with the earth. Remember when the local quack told you that coconut is the tree of life, that kind of bullshit? With leaves stretching beyond the firmament, roots piercing through the abyssal depths of hell, and a trunk whose girth is so large that men from all cultures learned to not give a single fuck about the tree. It was at this point when man started to distance themselves from their creator, and resort to astral projection, much to the dismay of their maker.  

He found himself wading through a sea of empty beer cans. Walls of insipid nature contrast the dead wainscoting below. “Shit,” he thought. “I need to clean this place up.” He scuttled across the room, looking for spare bin bags, but to no avail. He did find his fridge, though. Driven by his temptations, he snatched a handful of those cheap lagers with minimal effort. His motivation to tidy his room vanished as quickly as it came. “It ain’t prison if I’m having the time of my life every fucking day here”, mumbled his drunken self, with a hint of inadvertent scorn. It was a whimsical effort, and so he does his daily routine: booze. He has enough money to buy himself a lifetime’s worth of beer, and a little bit more saved up for his eventual demise.  

To the asshole who made my university experience harder: fuck you, your fake-ass “thank-yous” mean jack shit to me compared to the extent you freeloaded your bitch ass all the way until the panelists wasted their time milking and roasting our fucking work. Shit, come on mate, don’t you fucking dare tell me that you had a big excursion that coincides whenever I need your help in finishing this shit. Excuses like that fool no one, and cunts like you think you’re being slick and all, because you take advantage of my kindness that I’ll just do our work anyway and you can slide yourself past that. Your lip service outweighs all your contributions to our predicament. You know what? Nothing’s stopping me from ranting and putting this shit up here for everyone to see, because you know damn well that you’re not doing anything meaningful. Yes, I know that your help doesn’t need to be “that” impactful or influential, but shit, seeing you dodge my questions and proceed to ask if I can lend you my whole-ass fucking examination sheet? Just get the fuck out of here. I don’t give a shit on what kind of story you’re trying to paint a picture of me to your friends, cronies, whatever. The longer you hold on to that lie, the bigger the pressure in your head will endure. It seems to me that you hate getting told that you’re shit, so much that you hide yourself, even online. When was the last time you chatted shit up with me that shows you’re actually online, not hiding like a motherfucking pussy you are? Can’t recall? How about the time when the game you’re playing accidentally slipped on your status when you switched yourself to online, only to realize it immediately and quickly hide it from everyone’s eyes? You’re also supposed to help us finish our work from earlier during that time, yet you told us that you’re away from home, only for that shit to slip up unintentionally. If this still doesn’t hit you, then I don’t know what to make of you, but you’re definitely not my friend. Never was. Hell, you thought that I was all alone so you approached me, and you even suggested hints that this was the reason you came to me so suddenly. You also thought that I was that stupid, no-good, class bumpkin, so that’s why you gave me test answers that I never asked for. Seems like you survived going through high school pulling off this shit. Oh yeah, you’re a huge kiss-ass, and I caught you watching dancing, fair-skinned women with big tits on Instagram, in a public setting. I don’t regret writing all this, I just wanted to let off some steam, and I could’ve kept this shit to myself, but who cares? That’s it. Fuck you, leech.  

I love and hate my country. I like that you can get programs and not expect feds to come up knocking on your door. I dislike that getting stupid people in high positions is the norm. Our former colonialists must’ve been really happy when they realized that there’s no way in fucking hell that they’re managing two Spains’ worth of selfish meatheads that think praying solves all of their problems, instead of actually confronting and dealing with it. I’m one of those meatheads as well.  

Oh no, I’ve said too much, I haven’t said enough. Hesitate, whimper, breathe, calm down, calm the fuck down. All’s going to be fine, nothing’s gone wrong. Keep your shit together, push through even if you’re tired, soulless whimpering, like a shindig, rowdy, shit, can you make it? Defy against nature’s odds, be the man you can never be, deface the peak with your own sweat and blood, smear it with crystalline exhaustion, crack magic, fuck. You really need it, you need that fucking smoke, boy. Anger is a gift, I don’t care, just pummel through and call it a day. Be mad at the world because it owes you a lot of shit, fuck the upper-class bitches, you say. Fear not the cycles of life, dread naught, dreadnought, like the destroyers, blow shit blocking your path towards freedom, not a single care in this world, say ye. Renegades like you have that outlandish habit of defacing castle walls, as for you, they have no value but old bricks wasted on nobility, built over peasant lands. Snip, snap, rejuvenate, hesitate, burn, burn, burn the fucking Tillamook urn, desecrate the scrolls of law, click, clack, deprive yourself, cut all the strings, leave them twanging and dead set flailing, come on now, out of desperation you seek for a serene sanctuary, maybe Svalbard, with a modicum of serendipity, please, on a whim, what the fuck, you’re spiraling out of control, full downwards descent into madness, sickening, craving, lusting, for the hope that you’ve longed and yearned for, Miss Anthropocene, fucking shit. Damn, you’re the pissiest hothead to ever walk on Mother Earth’s left ass cheek. You did tell me last night that you waged war to your head.  

Smile. Be happy. Smile all your problems away, my brethren. Pray to God, He can solve all your problems. What? Your hands feel too tired to clasp? That’s okay, God can hear your thoughts and He understands what you need. No, no, just no. Shut the fuck up, no more playing this game of make-believe, fucking pretending to be unfazed by all the bull fucking shit that’s surrounding us. You keep looking your own world through rose-colored glasses, through those tinted chapel windows, you color your own life to the point that you obfuscate all the hard shit. You’re too optimistic, seeing good in all things bad. It’s okay to let all this shit out, fetters unshackled, headfirst, headstrong, and without a need for evangelical validation. I’m tired of all this shit, while I’m trying to solve my problems, with your stupid fucking ass getting in the way, every goddamn time, I wish I could scream out all of this bullshit in my head without you bitch asses acting all like I can do it and shit. Yes, I can do it, just get the fuck out of my way, I don’t need your help, what you’re proposing to do’s worth jack shit, because it sounds like a desperate attempt to form a mutual connection. God, I wish that I can bounce back from this. Damn, called His name again, despite not being there in the worst of times. Fuck you, I only heard your name whenever a religious nut fuck praises you over something, while they shrivel up all the tithes.  

I know someone who fakes to know something they have no idea about, for the sake of fitting in a conversation. “Yeah, League of Legends, yeah, I played… erm, Jean, y’know, guy with um, the gun? Counts to four? I just watched a stream and heard some dudes say it and…” shut the fuck up twat, you don’t know shit. “I like Furina too, from Genshin Impact, and uhh, love that blue theme she has on they clothes, that bitch.”  

“Hey man, you’re not allowed to listen to this particular Japanese song, because it’s used as an opening theme in this anime series, and you need to watch, like 5 seasons worth of 24 episodes each before jamming to that”, said in a very phlegmy cadence, by a deranged Monogatari fan. The fuck you mean I can’t jam to 恋愛サーキュレーション? Do I need to go through all that shit just to listen to this bop? Get the fuck outta here, bro. Take a bath, too. Your smell, and your greasy hair slick is reflecting all your disappointment on my face. Bet it smells like fuck in there when you’re having a marathon, not a real marathon, but you sitting your fat ass off and watching this weeb shit for hours.  

Being a programmer and all, I never had someone actually run the programs I wrote. It worked on my machine, my programs, so don’t blame me if it doesn’t on yours. Nah, I’m still responsible for writing code that works, not theirs. Can you recall all of your major accomplishments in the last five years? No? Yeah, nada.  

Fear breeds contempt in the heart of a man. One has to question this common trait, why do we hate what we don’t understand? Forced into a body and damned with intelligence, shoved into a soul, wired with circuitry you cannot control. A tradition so ancient, that evolution will circumvent, hell-bent on ideals instilled since birth, a price of life the fleshes worth. Somewhere in this organism’s development, separate path taken, possible defect awakened, some feel it was simply a choice, and use morality to strengthen their voice.  

I remember reading the Bible from the first grade, and there was a passage that suggested Lot was fucked by his two daughters. Looks like Moses was smoking all that burning bush.  

Big word make sound big sentence, big idea. I have transcended all the zeniths and nadirs of the photovoltaic and photosynthesis and aphelia marked unbound by time immemorial, the epitome of the sesquipedalian anthrax-inducing yeomen needs to helter-skelter and saunter mischievously masticate the purebred hollyhock that my thanatopsis vas deferens shan’t evoke mere denial that elucidates revanchist bourgeoisie defenestration of the depressed ennui echelon pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis floccinaucinihilipilification, etymological absurdist roots pointing maudlin astral planes in candid degeneracy, while the phalanx suffers from indistinct bacchanalia kerned and wrought havoc whence the animalcules came, and thither and yonder was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Paleontology and cryptozoology are my cantankerous and indominable cenotaph demesne placoderm arillate variegated shibboleth phantasmagoria, of the hagiographic bairn petrichor contumelious recalcitrant thesaurus-shagger, bowsprit chromatic aberration indictment run amok bathypelagic cnidarian abacination loch fusillade pulchritudinous chthonic apian feng shui steganography flagellant pell-mell. From the azimuth I scuttled over the paramount watchtower, word salad, and envisaged nothing but shut the fuck up and stop writing this shit.  

Midnight. I’m browsing YouTube during this time, and I’m jaded on what to watch, really. I did think about scouring my Watch Later playlist, but the thought that I have to actually find videos that I haven’t seen yet, is just intimidating. I can shuffle it, yes, but my device sucks and lags like hell every time I do it. Videos that I already watched pop up the most often, when I do this, and I know that I still have a lot of videos to look in that playlist. Seems to me that the best way to go is take a rest. Sleep, my guy, it’s already 3 in the morning. I can do all of my absurd pile of unfinished homework tomorrow. You’re slowly killing yourself the later you sleep, suicide. That’s something prevention efforts could never catch.  

Bro, why you gotta be so mean? Who in God’s name hurt you? There’s no reason for you to cuss this much, bro. Follow the path of Jesus like I do and be a good human being. I’m a pastor, and I don’t like seeing that there’s still hate lingering in this world. This is not the way God intended it to be. I’m using terms like “bro” to get along more with my fellow kids. I usually see them in front of the Lord’s chapel, but they don’t actually go inside to pray. I’m saddened by that because the youth is no longer engaging in church activities. I have no one but seniors to share my stories of good will. I don’t like the fact that they lean more on science and leisure, than our Lord Jesus Christ.  

Please shoot me on the back of my head. I don’t want to see your face while my world fades into black. Better not to inform me you’re going to do it. Guy at the store has their face all questioning and shit every time I come there to buy ropes, the quality is crap anyway so I only looked at it, never bought it. It looks like its gonna snap the moment it catches weight the same amount as mine.  

It’s interesting that war metaphors are frequently used in describing a person’s struggle with cancer. For example, it’s said that one battles with cancer, fights cancer, all that PTSD shit. Those who succumbed to it lost their battle with cancer. You declare war on cancer. If I get cancer and die from it, I’d like my grave to have something etched on it like: “He lost his internal siege with cancer, enduring it all during the final days of his life. He fought a brave stand.” Those damn sarcoma bitches, man. Slick. Told you man, these awareness ribbons don’t do shit.  

It was dawn and one of the seers sighted a dull reef from over yonder, hidden from the early slivers of sunlight, and the gentle waves of the ocean, almost coquettish. The captain was just recovering from a mutiny attempt by one of his former henchmen, which he banished to be marooned and left to die on an isolated island two moons ago. And so, they landed on the rocky shores this morning. Effective timekeeping gadgets are not an accessibility during this period. They have these hourglass things that they use to track how much time has passed for every island hop, counted by the number of times they flipped the hourglass whenever the bottom half gets filled with sand. Usually that only takes five, but this time it was around twenty. They also have a bunch of compasses and a sextant in tow, and the innate ability to determine if there is dry land nearby, by licking one’s finger and hoisting it up heavenwards, and feeling the direction of where the breeze comes from, if the explorers feel it. At first sight, they thought no one lived on the island, because the other islets they landed were like that. But human figures soon came out from the thickets, consisting of trees and shrubs never seen nor known by the eyes of white men. Eye contact was a first for both of the groups. Some of the men tried communicating with the other, but to no avail. Minutes passed, and it was silently agreed that they should try communicate in using hand signs, or gestures instead, while saying what they mean in their respective language, despite no one on both sides understood what the other party is saying. The white man came for spices, and land, while the natives came out of curiosity, trying to understand what was happening. A bunch of queer-looking people from the other side of the world suddenly barged in without notice, is what they mostly had in mind. Time has passed, and the white man can now be seen talking with the natives, in their language, or theirs, or both. It’s worth noting that the population of the indigenous to the island has dwindled significantly, and some are captured and enslaved by the colonizers. The desires of white men are now real. They view a future that this island will then be replaced with a white, Christian population, the original natives wiped out, simply because of their pagan ways of thinking. They will use religion to subjugate, and justify their unfair treatment to the men who came before them, because they certainly can.  

“Hey, hey, hey, fuck C++, right? Right? Python and React all the way! C++ and Bjarne can suck Zuckerberg’s schlong and choke from it, these languages suck! Fuck learning shit from school, right? I have AI on my side, that means I can just tell it whatever I want, and BAM! New website with code and all in just a few seconds! Better not tell this to anybody, I’ll keep this as my dirty little secret, I’m seriously fucked if my boss finds out what I’m doing. Well, fuck you! I’m raking up all these moola for myself because technically, I’m doing my job! ChatGPT and Perplexity? I’m in for a fucking treat! What? I’m fired? And my college degree revoked? I need to retake my college courses again? What the f…, who the hell told them this? Shit, if I see you here right now, I’mma beat your bitch ass! Come on man! That’s years of hard work right here, AI and shit, and you assholes just took it away from me! No, fuck this man, I’m not gonna learn all that algorithm shit again, ‘cause I don’t have no AI tools in me, fuck this shit. I swear to God, time was better when it was quarantine days and I can have ChatGPT generate answers for me because I’m an inconsiderate, hardworking, definitely good-willed student. Yeah, fuck you. I’m just gonna go back on playing Valorant, and browse big titty models on Instagram. I need to kiss more ass though and butt in on conversations that I’m not supposed to be in. I need to hoard more brownie points.”  

Let’s hang out. We exchanged messages for years but nothing like this has ever happened. You say stuff about me, I say stuff about you, we enjoy whatever happens. Trust me, the moment we do it, everything’s going to become dark. Do you ever wonder how we’ve managed to establish a connection for this long, as old as you? I mean, I’m just somebody your head conjured up, with the same face, looks, and personality. We can do it right now, I’ve already got the stuff in my bag, and the best conditions for us to do it. We should do it at the same time, yeah? Hang out. Literally do that. See stars for a brief moment and have it fade to nothingness, at the same time. You’re not alone now. See? Now, let’s get going, I’ve got the ropes and place to be, just get in the… thing. The world is just not meant to adjust on the things we really want.  

Don’t show it, just don’t. Hide. Keep hiding. Conceal. It just gets worse the more you show it. Keep it hidden from view. You’ll be into less trouble the more you hide, just hide, don’t show, tell no soul. Be silent, quiet, shush. Pretend you’re not there. Do your own thing. If you show it, even unintentionally, then that means you’re showing off, showboating. That’s bad, really, really bad. If someone asks you what you’re doing, always tell them nothing, or just dodge the question, ignore them. Less problems in that way. I’m not… like that, just keep hiding. How about, if you show something then you’re an attention whore. There.  

Hello, my name is Bob. I live in the Bronx. I work as cashier at a Wendy’s. I am a good neighbor, and I speak normally. Nothing weird to see here. I was made to contrast all my author’s angry tirades by introducing myself. I’m here to tell you that he’s okay. English is a difficult language. Have a nice day.  

Sowing the seeds of shit, fucking everything putting their hands against me, masturbating themselves to eventual self-satisfaction, twats seeking temporary adrenaline rushes for ephemeral moments of elation, you all damn suck, people taking advantage of other people is not a good pedestal to support yourself on, your heartstrings got you by the neck, put yourself out of your fucking misery, not supporting dick heads whose main motive is to deceive and manipulate their kin. Let all that fucking shit out, let it out, nothing’s stopping you, fuck the barricades preventing you to speak up, wake the fuck up from your dreamless slumber, be cognizant of all the treacherous bullshit that has been thrown at you, scream it all out to hell and fucking back, not a single care in the world, bullets speeding through the air hoping to see stars with your head, no, it don’t care no target to hit, fuck that, just let the fucking monster in your head out, unleash hell, don’t be afraid to spit scorching hellfire against the earth that has treated you like shit after all these years, be mad at the fucking world because you’re obliged to, don’t hide your anger behind that thin veil of yours, wake the fuck up and have those motherfuckers get the taste of their own medicine, I don’t care if it involves guns, killing and shit, you all bitches have scarred and done enough irreversible psychological fucking damage that I’ve become too mentally unstable to recover, so shut the fuck up and have this barrel stuck up, point-blank at the roof of your fucking mouth, no one cares if your brain matter splatters against the wall of shame you’ve built, your hypocrisy and insensitivity regarding our situation is a complete disgrace, I’m more happy that you’re fucking dead and rotting than living to breathe another life, ready to fuck with another innocent dude’s life. You built a podium founded on your own sins and lies, polished by honeyed words, meant to deceive innocent people from your lip services. I relate more to the rotting walls of my cell, confined to do time until I die, my sentence will outlive my life, my hair will become white first than my prison bars rust red, I’m destined to expire here alone. I etch the walls of my cell with a dull, pointed rock, where I count all the days of my duty by five, and I think, currently I have a couple thousand of tallies I can visibly see. Saliva comes out dry from my mouth, and blood is indeed thicker than water. All the people I see around me don bats and arms, where even a person wearing civilian garments are not a usual sight. I can’t see to find meanings between my tally marks, only dying white paint. The flakes seem to pile up on the floor, and are carried by the occasional wind, coming from the top of my cell. That tiny window up there is my only source of light; it’s pitch-black fucking dark when nighttime falls. I’m the jester in front of my audience, and I’m my own audience, and I laugh from my own jokes, where I occasionally choke and gag from inhaling shit dust floating in the air. Deranged and unhinged as I am, nothing stops me on trying to find my next bus stop to my next dominion, because it is in hell where she waits for me.
